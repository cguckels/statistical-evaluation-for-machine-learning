Evaluation Overview
###

The system performed a 10-fold cross validation for the following 3 models. 
The models were compared against the first baseline model. 
M0: LibLinear; nGrams: 2
M1: LibLinear; nGrams: 2, nGrams: 3
M2: LibLinear; nGrams: 2, nGrams: 4

The models were evaluated on the dataset Boston. Their performance was assessed with the Weighted F-Measure

Parametric Testing
The system compared the 3 models using the repeated-measures one-way ANOVA. Mauchly's test indicated a weak violation of Sphericity (p=0.093638, alpha=0.100000). Given that the assumptions are violated, the following test may be corrupted. The repeated-measures one-way ANOVA showed strong significant differences between the performances of the models (p=0.004658, alpha=0.010000).

The system performed the Dunett's test post-hoc. Given that the assumptions are violated, the following test may be corrupted. P-values:
    M0    M1    
M1  1.000 NaN   
M2  0.000 NaN   
The Dunett's test partly showed strong significant differences between the performances of the models ($\alpha=0.01$, Tbl. \ref{tbl:models}). These results do not allow for a strict ordering of all models. 

Non-Parametric Testing
The system compared the 3 models using the Friedman test. The Friedman test did not show significant differences between the performances of the models (p=0.122456, alpha=0.100000).

The system performed the Pairwise Wilcoxon signed-rank test post-hoc. P-values:
    M0    M1    
M1  0.922 NaN   
M2  0.037 NaN   
The Pairwise Wilcoxon signed-rank test partly showed medium significant differences between the performances of the models for non-adjusted p-values ($\alpha=0.05$, Tbl. \ref{tbl:models}). These results do not allow for a strict ordering of all models. 


Adjusted p-values according to Hochberg:
    M0    M1    
M1  0.922 NaN   
M2  0.074 NaN   

Adjusted p-values according to Holm:
    M0    M1    
M1  0.922 NaN   
M2  0.074 NaN   

Adjusted p-values according to Bonferroni:
    M0    M1    
M1  1.000 NaN   
M2  0.074 NaN   
It partly showed weak significant differences for adjusted p-values (alpha=0.10$).
