{"name":"STATSREP-ML","tagline":"Statistical Evaluation & Reporting Framework for Machine Learning Results","body":"STATSREP-ML is an open-source solution for automating the process of eval- uating machine-learning results. It calculates qualitative statistics, performs the appropriate tests and reports them in a comprehensive way. It largely, but not exclusively, relies on well-tested and robust statistics implementations in R, and uses the tests the machine-learning community largely agreed upon.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n* Straight-forward configuration, either programmatically or using an XML file.\r\n* Support for sample input from k-fold cross-validation, repeated cross-validation on one or multiple datasets, and train-test splits.\r\n* Support for two or >2 values of the independent variable, i.e. either classifiers or features. The appropriate tests for the number of groups are selected automatically. \r\n* Support for sample sets with two independent variables, by automatically splitting the data along a predefined fixed independent variable value.\r\n* Integration of both parametric and non-parametric omnibus- as well as post-hoc tests that are commonly used for comparing machine learning results. \r\n* Integration of specific parametric and non-parametric tests to compare multiple models against a baseline, and support for input data annotations to indicate the baseline model.\r\n* Automatic p-value correction and integration of several more and less conservative techniques for p-value adjustment.\r\n* Testing of parametric test assumptions such as normality and sphericity, allowing an easy application of these algorithms.\r\n* Generation of both a plain-text and a better structured \\LaTeX\\ report, comprising sample tables, qualitative statistics, basic graphs and the evaluation results.\r\n\r\n## Available Tests and Correction Methods\r\n  * Parametric, omnibus: dependent T-test, repeated Measure One-Way ANOVA\r\n  * Parametric, post-hoc: Dunett test, Tukey HSD test\r\n  * Non-parametric, omnibus: Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test, Friedman's test, McNemar test\r\n  * Non-parametric, post-hoc: Nemenyi test, pairwise Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test\r\n  * P-value correction methods: Bonferroni, Hochberg, Holm, Hommel, Benjamini-Hochberg, Benjamini-Yekuteli\r\n\r\nAdditional tests can be easily integrated by means of calling the corresponding R packages or by implementing them natively in Java (See Wiki!).\r\n\r\n\r\n## How to Cite?\r\nIf you use STATSREP-ML in research, please cite the following paper ([Download](http://tuprints.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/4294/1/Report_Final.pdf)):\r\n\r\nChristian Guckelsberger, Axel Schulz (2014).
